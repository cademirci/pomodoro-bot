# Pomodoro Discord Bot

A Pomodoro timing bot for Discord users. Pomodoro is a studying technique which recommends working in 25 and 5 minutes intervals. This bot warns the user by sending messages periodically according to Pomodoro algorithm.

In order for me to provide a valid usage, you have to have a Discord developer account and create a bot. I cannot provide a Discord server that can execute Node for the bot. Take a developer key and open `bot.js`, uncomment the line `// const developerKey = YOUR_KEY;`, then change it properly.

Node modules is also in the repository, you can just run below after having `npm` and `nodejs`.

```
node bot.js
```

You are welcome to submit corrections and additions.
